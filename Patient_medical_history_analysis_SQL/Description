Data was genererated using Synthea, a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Their mission is to output high-quality synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions, enabling research with Health IT data that is otherwise legally or practically unavailable. De-identified real data still presents a challenge in the medical field because there are peopel who excel at re-identification of these data. For that reason the average medical center, etc. will not share their patient data. Most governmental data is at the hospital level. NHANES data is an exception.
